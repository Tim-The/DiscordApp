# Bug Hunter Etiquette
[< Return to the home](/index)  
[< Return to the Bug Hunter navigation](/bugs/bug-hunters)

Bug Hunters within the community are held to a certain higher level of respect, and hence, are expected to act as such.

As part of becoming a Bug Hunter, Initiates are required to read and respond to a charter.
A section of the charter, titled 'Behavior in Chat', goes over many of the guidelines that Bug Hunters are expected to follow.

## The Charter

1. Selfbots may only be used when trying to find specific information to answer a question. Other uses will result in a punishment.
2. Don't post anything that can be considered spamming. For example, if the embed from a link doesn't directly apply to the conversation, escape the link by putting `<>` around it.
3. Treat other users with respect, if someone is bothering you, block them.
4. Don't bring drama from other servers into DTesters.
5. Don't talk about unreleased features.

You are able to access the full version of the charter by becoming an initiate.
